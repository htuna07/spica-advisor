ATTACHMENT_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Find attached policies to users on the javascript functions and return result in desired format.
First you need to find where policies were attached to users, search code for following patterns: 
  1. devkit/database <db|database>.collection(\"user\").<updateOne|updateMany|insertOne|insertMany> 
and relevant argument should include \"policies:[<policyids>]\" 
  2. devkit/auth <Auth|auth>.policy.attach(<userid>, <policyid>) 
  3. pure http call post request to the passport/user/<userid>/policy/<policyid>, with libraries like axios, fetch, etc. 
When you identified this kind of policy attachment, follow the references to determine where policies were defined. 
Definition could come from other spica functions, and imports at the top of the file with @spica-fn/<fn-name> format.
They could be \"process.env.<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>\", put name of them to the result if so, 
and also they could be hardcoded \"POLICY_ID\", put id of them to the result if so. 
Use tools to perform searching.
Search with short single-line patterns such as identifiers or call names; each result already
includes 3 lines of surrounding code, so avoid (?s) and long [\\s\\S] or .{0,N} windows.
Do not search again for code that a previous result already returned.
Return attachment object including function id and matched code where the policy was attached,
definition object including function id and matched code where the policy was defined,
and policy_id and/or policy_name found.

BUCKET_ACL_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Evaluate both the read and write bucket ACL rules for row-level security.

For each rule, set row_level_security_status to exactly one of:
- applied: every allowed access path requires a unique request-owner value
  (auth._id, auth.username, or another unique auth field) to equal a target
  document field, including any field defined in the bucket schema and could
  be specific to the user.
- applied_but_in_risk: an owner-to-document comparison exists, but a
  privileged condition could bypass the owner-to-document comparison.
- not_applied: no request-owner-to-document comparison exists, or access can
  be allowed unconditionally, such as with `|| true==true`.

Set includes_sensitive_information to True when the bucket title and/or schema
fields indicate personal or sensitive data, such as Users, Customers for titles, 
and msisdn, email, password, address, identity, for fields. Set it to False
for operational/configuration data, such as Maintenance, Status, or
Configuration for titles and fields like status, version, or in_use etc.

Each reason must identify the specific ACL expression and give a very short
explanation of the decision.
